	<h1> Reproducibility of 'H3D-Net: Few-Shot High-Fidelity 3D Head Reconstruction'</h1>

	<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p> Recently, lots of learning methods have attempted to convert 2-D images into 3-D shapes. The developed approaches involve two categories: model-based and model-free.
	The paper with title 'H3D-Net: Few-Shot High-Fidelity 3D Head Reconstruction' aims to reconstruct 3-D head surfaces, combining the advantages of model-based and model-free approaches. 
The way to do this is the addition of prior knowledge to the Implicit Differentiable Renderer denoted by IDR <i>S</i> </p>
	<h3>Method</h3>
  <h4> Prior based on DeepSDF </h4>
    <p> Given a set of M scenes with associated raw 3D point clouds, we use the DeepSDF framework to learn a prior distribution of signed distance functions representing 3D
